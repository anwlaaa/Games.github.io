                  <p> Her old neighborhood, District 12, was destroyed by the Capitol, and she now lives in District 13. 
                      Twelve districts in Panem have taken up arms against President Snow's oppression and the Capitol's greed. 
                      Katniss must now serve as the rebellion's face, their Mockingjay, or risk losing her loved ones' life. </p>

                      <p>Katniss' devotion is split between Peeta and Gale, and she knows she'll have to pick between the two or risk losing both. 
                          Unable to make a decision, she wants to be put into action, hoping to be more than a symbol for the rebels. 
                          Katniss leads the group while concealing her true intention, which is to assassinate President Snow herself.</p>

                  <p>Katniss stands there in awe as a Capitol hovercraft rains explosives on the city. 
                      Many people are killed, including Primrose, Katniss' sister. Katniss is in critical condition.
                      Katniss learns that the rebels have won during her recovery, which is delayed by her sadness over the death of her sister. 
                      Katniss discovers that the bomb that killed her sister was dropped by Panem's new president, 
                      Coin. </p>

                          Katniss prepares to fire her bow at Snow, but she moves her weapon to Coin at the last moment. 
                          Katniss is jailed after the new president dies in an instant.</p>

                          Haymitch and Katniss have returned to their Victor's Circle homes. Soon, Peeta joins them, and the three begin to heal. </p><br>
                      <p> Katniss and Peeta find love with each other once again, and a new tranquility in the knowing that their children will never know the nightmares of the Hunger Games.</p>
